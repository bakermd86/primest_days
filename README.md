Just a simple tool for looking for very prime seconds. Can filter on date and time separately, or date and time together. 

For example: Selecting "Hour" will filter for only hours which are prime, while "hh:mm:ss" would filter for times such that hhmmss is prime. These are all applied simultaneously, so when selecting many filters date/times matching those filters will have many prime numbers associated with them.

Selecting a date/time from the list will display all of those prime number values and the formats that produced them from the input date/time.
